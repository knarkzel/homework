#+TITLE: Homework for Rust: Structs and Enums

* *Problem 1*

Define a struct named =Person= with the following fields:

- =name=: A string representing the person's name
- =age=: An integer representing the person's age
- =email=: A string representing the person's email address

\noindent
After defining the =Person=, create a =Person= from this description:
James is 37 years old, and his email is james@gmail.com

* Problem 2

Create a struct named =Counter= with a single field =count= of type =u32=.
Then, implement two methods for the =Counter= struct:

- =new=: Creates a new =Counter= instance with an initial count of 0.
- =increment=: Increments the count by 1.

* Problem 3

Create an enum named =Direction= with four variants:

- =Up=
- =Down=
- =Left=
- =Right=

\noindent
Implement a method named =move_point= that takes two parameters: a tuple
struct =Point= with =x= and =y= coordinates (both of type i32) and a =Direction=
instance. The method should return a new =Point= instance with the updated
coordinates based on the given direction:

- =Up=: Decrease the =y= coordinate by 1
- =Down=: Increase the =y= coordinate by 1
- =Left=: Decrease the =x= coordinate by 1
- =Right=: Increase the =x= coordinate by 1

* Problem 4

Create an enum named =Shape= with three variants:

- =Circle=: Takes a single parameter representing the radius (as a floating-point number).
- =Rectangle=: Takes two parameters representing the width and height (both as floating-point numbers).
- =Triangle=: Takes three parameters representing the lengths of the three sides (all as floating-point numbers).
  
\noindent
Implement a method named =area= for the =Shape= enum that calculates and returns the area of the corresponding shape. Use the following formulas for the different shapes:

- =Circle=: $\pi \cdot \text{{radius}}^2$
- =Rectangle=: $\text{{width}} \cdot \text{{height}}$
- =Triangle=: $\sqrt{{s \cdot (s - \text{{side1}}) \cdot (s - \text{{side2}}) \cdot (s - \text{{side3}})}}, \text{{ where }} s = \frac{{\text{{side1}} + \text{{side2}} + \text{{side3}}}}{2}$
