* *Task 1: Design Your Creatures (Using Structs)*

In your Rust-powered realm, you need a variety of creatures to populate
the land. Create at least three unique creatures using structs. Each
creature should have a name, a type (e.g., "Goblin," "Elf," "Dragon"),
health points, and attack power. Write a Rust program that defines
these creatures and their attributes. This means you need at least three different
structs with these fields.

* Task 2: Create Your Magical Items (Using Enums)

No adventure is complete without magical items! Design a set of enchanting
items using enums. Create three types of items: weapons, armor, and
consumables. Each enum variant should have different attributes such
as damage points for weapons, defense points for armor, and effects
for consumables (use *[[https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/custom_types/enum.html][struct-like]]* syntax). Write Rust code to showcase the different types of
magical items you've created.

* Task 3: Train Your Creatures (Implementing Methods)

Your creatures need to be battle-ready! Implement a method for your
creatures that allows them to train and improve their attributes. For
instance, a creature could gain extra health or attack power through
training. Write Rust code that demonstrates how a creature's attributes
change after training. You should at least have a =train(&self)=.
